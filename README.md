# ETL_Midterm_Mitchel_413
Project that show full ETL pipeline

## Project Overview
An entire ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for sales order data is demonstrated in this project.  Gathering raw sales data from multiple sources (CSV files), cleaning and enriching it, and then loading the refined data into an effective storage format (Parquet files) so it can be further analysed and reported on are the main objectives.

The pipeline involves:
- Obtaining incremental and raw datasets from CSV files.
-  Data cleansing, enrichment, filtering, and or structuring.
- For effective storage and querying, the converted data should be saved in Parquet format.
